# reversi@self
Reversi for two players, Akashic content (http://akashic-games.github.io/).

Place disks and flip them as you like. We have more interactive time with @self.  

The repository provides the fast game development. It contains two parts, `reversi` (game specific), and `@self` (common board game). We are able to release new games only by modifying the specific parts. Following games are also created by this set:
* Shogi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi),
* Chess (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess), and
* Diamond (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_checkers#Diamond_game).
